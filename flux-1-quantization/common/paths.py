"""Workspace resolution.

Checkpoints are large. FLUX.1-dev BF16 alone is roughly 34 GB, and a full run
with both arms plus exports needs 250 GB or more. Home directories on shared
clusters are far too small, so every stage writes under a single workspace root
chosen here.

Resolution order:

1. ``--workspace`` on the command line.
2. ``FLUX_QUANT_WORKSPACE`` in the environment.
3. Auto-detection: persistent scratch first, then node-local RAID.

Node-local RAID is fast but usually disappears when the allocation ends. When
the workspace looks node-local we say so loudly rather than letting someone
discover it after a four-hour run.
