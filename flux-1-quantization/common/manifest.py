"""Run provenance.

Everything this harness produces is meant to be handed to someone else and
re-run. That only works if we record exactly what produced it: GPU, driver,
container, library versions, model revisions, and the commands as executed.

Each stage appends to ``results/run_manifest.json``. Nothing here needs a GPU,
so the manifest still gets written when a stage fails.
