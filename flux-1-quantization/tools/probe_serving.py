"""Report which documented consumers of the packed export are actually available.

Model Optimizer writes ``--hf-ckpt-dir`` for **SGLang, vLLM and TRT-LLM**. A stock
Diffusers pipeline is not on that list and rejects the checkpoint, which is
expected rather than a defect -- but it is easy to stop there and conclude the
checkpoint does not serve. It only means the wrong loader was used.

This script does no GPU work and loads no weights. It answers three questions:

1. Which of the three runtimes can be imported here at all?
2. Does the installed TensorRT-LLM ship anything diffusion-shaped -- a VisualGen
   module, a FLUX model definition, an example config?
3. Does the export on disk look like something a serving stack would accept?

Run it before writing any loader code, because the answers decide what the loader
should even call. Guessing at an API and reporting the resulting ImportError as a
finding wastes everyone's time, including the engineering team's.
