# would show a 12x "speedup" that is entirely step count.

# No quant_config in this YAML, deliberately. VisualGen has two ways to learn
# that a model is quantized and they disagree by design:
#
#   * config_groups in the checkpoint  -> `dynamic` defaults to FALSE (static)
#   * quant_config in this YAML        -> `dynamic` defaults to TRUE  (runtime)
#
# Our export declares "dynamic": false. Supplying quant_config here would
# override it and re-quantize at load time, and the only symptom would be a
# speedup that never arrives. Leaving it out lets the checkpoint speak.

Nothing has been run. Fix these first -- a partial benchmark is worse than
none, because the arms that do work still write numbers and a table missing
its BF16 row reads like a result.
