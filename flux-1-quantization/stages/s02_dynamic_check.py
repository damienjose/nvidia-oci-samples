"""Dynamic NVFP4 quality check.

Run this before the static export. Dynamic quantization computes the scaling
factors at runtime from the activations, so it needs no calibration pass and no
exported checkpoint: point the runtime at the ordinary BF16 model and generate.

The reason this is worth doing first is that dynamic and static NVFP4 should
land at the same accuracy. The GEMM path is identical; only the source of the
scale differs. So if quality holds here it will hold for the static export, and
we learn that in an hour rather than after a full calibration and export cycle.

Two backends:

* ``diffusers`` uses Hugging Face Diffusers with TorchAO NVFP4. Fewer moving
  parts, and it is the path the sibling benchmarking sample already exercises.
* ``visualgen`` uses TensorRT-LLM VisualGen, which is the runtime we expect to
  serve from. Its exact invocation should be confirmed against the container in
  use; the shipped config is ``examples/visual_gen/configs/flux1-dev-fp4-1gpu.yaml``.
