"""Report exactly which layers were quantized, and check the exclusion filter.

The question this answers is "did the public Model Optimizer recipe do what it
claims", which matters because it is the first question anyone adopting this
will ask before
adopting it.

Three things are reported, in order of how much they can be trusted:

1. **Which modules carry 4-bit weights and which stayed at high precision.**
   Read straight off the tensor dtypes, so it is fact, not inference. Packed
   NVFP4 weights are stored as ``U8``; anything still ``BF16`` was not quantized.

2. **Whether the exclusion filter agrees.** If ``MODELOPT_DIFFUSERS_DIR`` points
   at a Model-Optimizer checkout, the real ``filter_func`` is imported and
   evaluated against every module name we found. That is authoritative: it is the
   same code the export ran. Any layer the filter wanted excluded but which
   carries 4-bit weights, or vice versa, is a genuine defect and is reported as
   a disagreement.

3. **A comparison against the published checkpoint**, which is weak evidence and
   labelled as such. Black Forest Labs ship ComfyUI format and we produce
   Diffusers, so tensor names do not line up and the tensor sets cover different
   components. Only the transformer is compared, and only on precision mix.

Why not just pattern-match layer names: leaf names repeat. FLUX has a model-level
``proj_out`` **and** a ``proj_out`` inside all 38 single transformer blocks. A
substring test cannot tell them apart, and reporting the per-block projections as
wrongly-quantized would be a false alarm — they are ordinary large GEMMs and
quantizing them is the point. Module depth is tracked so the two never merge.
