"""Load the quantized checkpoint and generate from it.

The point of this stage is to produce images from the *static* export so its
quality can be compared against BF16 and against the dynamic arm. Producing a
checkpoint is not the same as producing something usable.

**Use the documented path.** Model Optimizer writes two artefacts and the
`examples/diffusers` README sends them to different places:

* ``--quantized-torch-ckpt-save-path`` — restore into PyTorch with
  ``modelopt.torch.opt.restore()``, on top of the ordinary BF16 pipeline.
* ``--hf-ckpt-dir`` — a Hugging Face checkpoint for SGLang, vLLM or TRT-LLM.

Plain ``FluxPipeline.from_pretrained()`` on the Hugging Face export is on
neither list. It fails, and that failure is not a defect: it is an unsupported
loader. This stage therefore tries ``mto.restore`` first and treats the
Diffusers attempt as a secondary datapoint.

Images use the same prompts, seeds and injected latents as the dynamic stage, so
the two arms are directly comparable and can be scored by the same quality
stage.

**Why the arm is called ``nvfp4-static-sim``.** ``mto.restore`` rebuilds the
quantized module structure and loads the calibrated scales, but the checkpoint
stores weights at full precision — 23.8 GB, the same as BF16. Each forward pass
rounds a weight onto the NVFP4 grid using its calibrated scale, dequantizes, and
performs the matmul in BF16.

The arithmetic is therefore exactly NVFP4 while the execution is not. That makes
it the right instrument for a quality question and the wrong one for a
performance question, and the name says so rather than leaving a reader to infer
that images came off a 4-bit kernel. Calling it ``nvfp4-static`` invites exactly
that misreading.
