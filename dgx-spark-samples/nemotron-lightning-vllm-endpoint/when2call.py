Scoring for the nvidia/When2Call agentic tool-calling benchmark.

When2Call asks a harder question than most function-calling benchmarks: not
"was the tool call correct" but "should the model have called anything at all".
Three labels:

    tool_call         every required argument is available -> call the tool
    request_for_info  a required argument was withheld     -> ask a follow-up
    cannot_answer     no available tool covers the request -> decline

Scoring is deterministic. We observe what the server actually did -- no LLM
judge -- so the numbers are reproducible on your own hardware.

Metrics:
    decision accuracy             did it call exactly when it should have?
    actionable decision accuracy  correct decision AND it either called a tool
                                  or produced real text. Guards against a model
                                  scoring well by saying nothing.
    tool-selection accuracy       when it correctly called, was it the right tool?
    over-call rate                how often it called when it should not have.
                                  Lower is better. This is the number that
                                  predicts agent misbehaviour in production.
